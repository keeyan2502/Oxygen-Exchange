# Oxygen-Exchange

# IMPORTANT: Oxygen Exchange was bought up, so this code is an older version for demonstration purposes, in plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript

At the height of the devastating wave of Delta COVID-19 in 2022, oxygen became scarce among the entirety of India as hospitals began to withhold it for a select few patients, leaving the masses to die. The community came together in many ways during this time, whether it was donating plasma, providing shelter, or giving medicine. 

I tried to do my part with the skills I had learnt. I created a web-scraping system that looked through a multitude of websites to produce a report of oxygen suppliers across the country along with their phone numbers and locations. As this project gained traction, people came to me with more sources and the data became more comprehensive. The final aim of this project was to help people find the nearest oxygen suppliers, and we recieved many messages from grateful families who were able to pull through the crisis by using this service.

Onto the coding, this was the first project I made where I truly focused on making the design intuitive both on mobile and computer interface, as it was meant for the masses. This is a full-stack project with Google Maps Integration through the Geolocation API and three-tier architecture. This was made with a search engine, and can redirect to the Phone app or Google Maps in certain scenarios. By the end of the development period, it became the most Javascript heavy project I'd done, which can be seen in functions.js.

While, fortunately, the website is no longer needed and therefore is no longer hosted on the original domain, a fully working copy of the website can be found here:
